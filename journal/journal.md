What I Learned today:
Today I learned the basic functionalities of Github, mainly in how to add directories as well as how to set up a repository. I also learned about the importance of git add, git commit, and git push and how exactly to utilize them.

What I'm still confused about:
I am confused as to how I can get rid of a .md file or instance of the journal part from a repository.
