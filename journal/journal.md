What I Learned today:
Today I learned that on my computer, git commit can only save and submit one instance at a time as indicated by the off numbering scheme.

What I'm still confused about:
I would like to know if there is a more efficient way to send multiple of these at once, or perhaps a way to send multiple of these types of files at once.
