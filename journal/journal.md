What I Learned today:
Today I learned how to do various things incorporating IntelliJ, GitHub, and Google as well as how to obtain client IDs, client secrets, and about details regarding controllers and Security functions.

What I'm still confused about:
How do I remember all of this information at once and incorporate it to do it at the same time? Because my weakness is minor coding mistakes.
